GTMRS
=====
Analyze,	specify,	design,	implement,	document	and	demonstrate	an	information	
system	application	to	support	a	new	Georgia	Tech	Medical	Records	System	called	
GTMRS.		You	are	required	to	use	the	Classical	Methodology	for	Database	
Development.		The	system	should	be	implemented	using	a	relational	DBMS	that	
supports	standard	SQL	queries.		Class	administrators	will	provide	you	with	
information	about	how	to	access	a	college-managed	MySQL	server	in	order	to	
implement	your	database	and	the	application.		The	professors	must	approve	any	
other	alternative	implementations.	

Phase	I	(hard	copy)	
	
The	deliverables	include:	
1. A	cover	page	listing	all	members	in	the	team	with	their	respective	sections	
and	email	addresses	and	T-square	username.	
2. Enhanced	Entity	Relationship	(EER)	Diagram	
3. Information	Flow	Diagram	
4. A	list	of	logical	constraints	that	will	be	enforced.	Do	not	include	any	
constraints	that	can	be	shown	in	the	ER	diagram,	but	rather	semantic,	
business	logic	related	constraints.		You	are	required	to	include	at	least	five	
constraints,	although	a	fully-specified	system	will	probably	have	more	
than	that.		Constraints	that	can	be	specified	directly	using	ER	notation	
will	not	count	toward	the	five	required.		
5. Any	assumptions	made	including	explanations.			
Notes:	
1. The	EER	must	capture	the	constraints	of	the	system	as	much	as	possible	
whenever	applicable,	i.e.	total	participation,	super/sub	class,	weak	entities.	
2. The	design	of	your	system	must	satisfy	all	the	constraints.	You	are	allowed	to	
make	up	additional	assumptions	and	constraints	as	long	as	they	do	not	
conflict	with	the	specified	constraints	and	requirements.		If	possible,	those	
additional	assumptions	and	constraints	should	be	included	in	the	ER	
diagram.	
You	must	turn	in	a	hard	copy	of	your	report	in	class	

Phase	II	(hard	copy)	
1. Cover	Page	
2. Copy	of	the	ER	Diagram	(either	from	phase	I	(with	any	revisions)	or	from	the	
solution	provided)	
3. Copy	of	the	Information	Flow	Diagram	from	phase	I	(either	from	phase	I	
(with	any	revisions)	or	from	the	solution	provided)	
4. Task	Decomposition	Diagram		
5. Relational	Schema	Diagram	(with	primary	and	foreign	keys	identified,	
referential	integrity	is	shown	by	arrows)	
6. Create	Table	statements,	including	domain	constraints,	integrity	constraints,	
primary	keys,	and	foreign	keys	
7. SQL	statements	for	each	task	(follow	the	template	in	the	phase	II	design	
methodology)
